# Personal Blog

This project is a simple personal blog that allows you to write and publish articles. The blog has two main sections: a guest section accessible to everyone and an admin section accessible only to the blog's owner.

## Features

### Guest Section

- **Home Page**: Displays a list of all published articles with a title, publication date, and a short description.
- **Article Page**: Displays the full content of a selected article along with its publication date.

### Admin Section

- **Dashboard**: Displays a list of all articles with options to add new articles, edit existing ones, or delete articles.
- **Add Article Page**: Contains a form for creating and publishing a new article with fields for the title, content, and publication date.
- **Edit Article Page**: Contains a form for editing an existing article with fields pre-filled with the current title, content, and publication date.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Used to structure the content of the web pages.
- **CSS**: Used to style the web pages.
